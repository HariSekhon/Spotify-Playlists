usage_description="
Filters tracks URIs to only output tracks not already existing in the major playlist files saved here

Useful to find tracks in playlists such as Liked Songs that aren't saved to the main playlists

Accepts track URIs from stdin and prints them to stdout for further processing (eg. piping to spotify_uri_to_name.sh) or loading straight to playlists
