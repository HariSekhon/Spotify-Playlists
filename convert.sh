usage_description="
Convert every playlist under spotify/ to human readable format at top level
using bash-tools/spotify/spotify_uri_to_name.sh

Git diff should show no differences between this result and the
spotify_playlist_backup.sh playlists human output at the top level

This is intended to run once in a while as an extra verification
as it takes a long time do query the Spotify API for all these tracks
