# 1. Used iPhone explorer to copy the whole Shazam dir to Mac
# 2. grep -R the dir for a known song nme to find the location of the data, was in a sqlite DB
# 3. figured out DB internal to get a basic join of Artist - Track selects with | as the separator
# 4. Pipe through shell to munge and enjoy! :)
# 5. Took back using this select to txt file Shazam-dump-$(date +%F).txt
# 6. WARNING: for some reason this doesn't seem to have the very latest tags in it
# 7. Also there is something wrong with this list, Adele - Church for Thugs???

# Turns out the original query was wrong, that's why Artist - Tracks were getting muddled
