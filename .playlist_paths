# Because Spotify API doesn't expose the directories so we have to map them here

# Avoids polluting the top level namespace by putting things like Love Island playlist episodes under subdirectories

# Latest match in this file wins so put more specific matches at the bottom

# Format:
#
# Playlist Regex	\t\t..	Directory_Path

Love Island UK			Love_Island_UK/
Love Island US			Love_Island_UK/

# Use capture group of the season number to avoid creating a mapping for every new season
Love Island UK Season \d+	Love_Island_UK/Season_\1/
Love Island US Season \d+	Love_Island_US/Season_\1/

#  YYYY MM
