usage_description="
Iterates over and commits all downloaded Spotify playlists in \$PWD or playlists/ directory,
showing diffs and then committing each in turn

First shows only the net removals in standard Spotify URIs + Track Name for a playlist
to check if anything has been lost from a playlist (additions don't need as much scrutiny)

Drastically reduces net removals list for human review by omitting duplicate URI removals
(checks if URI is present in the spotify format playlist) or URI replacements for same song
(either URI remapping or single vs album)

If there are no net removals then auto-commits the playlist

Otherwise shows the list of net removals in both Spotify URI and Track name formats
followed by the full human readable playlist diff and spotify URI diff underneath

If satisfactory, hitting enter at the end of the playlist diff will commit both
the Spotify URI and human readable playlist simultaneously

Requires DevOps-Perl-tools to be in \$PATH for diffnet.pl
