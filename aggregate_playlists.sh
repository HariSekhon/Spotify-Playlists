Ensure tracks in more specialized playlists are also in their super mega mix playlist parents

The mappings are in the local aggregations/ directory, each file being named after the mega mix playlist and each line of contents being the playlist from while to filter to

Takes a full backup before starting to avoid loading duplicates due to out of date local playlists
